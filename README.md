As you can see, the elevator in question has some issues. The buttons are very hard to press, and have no indication that you have pressed them. There have been times where I thought I pressed it and stould there for a good 5 seconds before realizing that I had to push harder. The buttons are not designed well. Someone could easily think that the black part is the button and try to press it. The braille is also located away from the button, making it much more difficult to use.
