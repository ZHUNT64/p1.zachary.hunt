As you can see, the elevator in question has some issues. The buttons are very hard to press, and have no indication that you have pressed them. There have been times where I thought I pressed it and stould there for a good 5 seconds before realizing that I had to push harder. The buttons are not designed well. Someone could easily think that the black part is the button and try to press it. The braille is also located away from the button, making it much more difficult to use.

In my concept, making the buttons clearer and circular with the braille located directly on the button would help with usability. This makes the interface user friednly as the buttons and text have high contrast with the surrounding area making it far easier to see. The buttons would not have a separate label. The most common action in an elevator is pressing the button for the floor you want to go to, making them as clear as possible allows for the user to figure out how the interface works far quicker, making it more efficient.

Making the interface as a touchscreen in processing, helps vizualize what can be done to improve upon it. Again, high contrast and a minimalistc design makes the usability of the interface that much better.
